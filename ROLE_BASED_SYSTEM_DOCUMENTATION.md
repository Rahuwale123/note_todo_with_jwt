## System Overview

This FastAPI backend implements a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system with **multi-tenant organization support**. Users belong to organizations and have different permission levels based on their assigned roles.

### Key Features
- ‚úÖ **Two distinct user roles**: ADMIN and MEMBER
- ‚úÖ **Multi-tenant architecture**: Complete data isolation between organizations
- ‚úÖ **Automatic role assignment**: Based on signup type
- ‚úÖ **Organization-based data access**: Users only see their organization's data
- ‚úÖ **JWT authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- ‚úÖ **Permission enforcement**: Role-based access control on all endpoints
- ‚úÖ **Organization discovery**: Easy signup with organization names
- ‚úÖ **Personal content filtering**: Users can view their own content separately

## User Roles

### 1. ADMIN Role üè¢
**Description**: Organization owners with full system access
**Permissions**:
- ‚úÖ Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) on all resources
- ‚úÖ Manage organization users (change roles, remove users)
- ‚úÖ Full access to notes and todos
- ‚úÖ Can delete any content within their organization
- ‚úÖ View organization user list

**Use Cases**:
- Company founders
- Team leaders
- Project managers
- System administrators

### 2. MEMBER Role üë•
**Description**: Regular users with limited permissions
**Permissions**:
- ‚úÖ Create and Read resources
- ‚úÖ Update their own content (todos only)
- ‚úÖ View personal content (my-notes, my-todos)
- ‚ùå Cannot delete any content
- ‚ùå Cannot update notes
- ‚ùå Cannot view organization user list
- ‚ùå Cannot manage other users

**Use Cases**:
- Team members
- Employees
- Regular users
- Content contributors

## Signup Process

### How Signup Works

The signup system now **always requires an organization name** and automatically determines user roles based on whether the organization exists or not. This gives users full control over their organization names.

#### 1. ADMIN Signup (New Organization) üÜï

**Request Format:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/signup" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "john_admin",
    "password": "securepass123",
    "organization_name": "Acme Corporation"
  }'
```

**What Happens:**
1. System checks if "Acme Corporation" exists
2. Since it doesn't exist, creates new organization with that exact name
3. Assigns `ADMIN` role to the user
4. User becomes the owner of "Acme Corporation"

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "username": "john_admin",
  "role": "ADMIN",
  "organization_id": 1,
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
  "updated_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00"
}
```

#### 2. MEMBER Signup (Join Existing Organization) ‚ûï

**Request Format:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/signup" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "jane_member",
    "password": "securepass123",
    "organization_name": "Acme Corporation"
  }'
```

**What Happens:**
1. System checks if "Acme Corporation" exists
2. Since it exists, assigns `MEMBER` role to the user
3. User joins the existing "Acme Corporation" organization

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "username": "jane_member",
  "role": "MEMBER",
  "organization_id": 1,
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T11:00:00",
  "updated_at": "2024-01-15T11:00:00"
}
```

### Organization Name Requirements

**Rules for Organization Names:**
- **Always Required**: Every signup must include `organization_name`
- **Unique**: Organization names must be unique across the system
- **Case-Sensitive**: "Acme Corp" and "acme corp" are different organizations
- **Professional**: Users can create meaningful, professional organization names

**Example Organization Names:**
```json
{
  "username": "ceo_sarah",
  "password": "ceopass123",
  "organization_name": "Tech Solutions Inc"
}

{
  "username": "dev_mike",
  "password": "devpass123",
  "organization_name": "Tech Solutions Inc"
}
```

**Result:**
- `ceo_sarah` becomes ADMIN of "Tech Solutions Inc"
- `dev_mike` becomes MEMBER of "Tech Solutions Inc"

### Organization Selection for Members

**How Members Choose Their Organization:**

1. **Organization Discovery**: Members can see all available organizations
2. **Search by Name**: Members can search for organizations by name
3. **Direct Organization Name**: Members specify the exact organization name during signup

**Example Organization Selection:**
```json
{
  "username": "new_team_member",
  "password": "memberpass123",
  "organization_name": "Tech Solutions Inc"  // Joins existing organization
}
```

**Important Notes:**
- **Exact Match Required**: Organization name must match exactly (case-sensitive)
- **No Auto-Creation**: If organization doesn't exist, user becomes ADMIN of new org
- **Professional Names**: Users can create meaningful company names instead of auto-generated ones

## Security Implementation

### JWT Token Structure
```json
{
  "sub": "username",
  "user_id": 123,
  "organization_id": 1,
  "role": "ADMIN",
  "exp": 1705312800
}
```

### Security Features
1. **Token Expiration**: 24 hours (configurable)
2. **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with salt
3. **Role Validation**: Server-side role checking
4. **Organization Isolation**: Data access restricted by org
5. **Permission Middleware**: Automatic role enforcement

### Authentication Flow
```
1. User submits credentials ‚Üí /api/v1/auth/login
2. Server validates credentials
3. Server generates JWT with user info
4. Client stores JWT token
5. Client includes JWT in Authorization header
6. Server validates JWT and extracts user info
7. Server checks permissions based on user role
8. Server allows/denies access accordingly
```

## Best Practices

### For Admins
1. **Share Organization Name**: Provide organization name to new team members
2. **Monitor Users**: Regularly check organization user list
3. **Manage Content**: Review and moderate notes and todos
4. **Security**: Keep admin credentials secure
5. **User Management**: Use role updates instead of removing users when possible

### For Members
1. **Get Organization Name**: Ask your admin for the organization name
2. **Respect Permissions**: Don't attempt unauthorized operations
3. **Collaborate**: Create and contribute content within your role limits
4. **Personal Content**: Use my-notes and my-todos for personal organization
5. **Report Issues**: Contact admin for permission-related problems

### For Developers
1. **Role Validation**: Always check user roles before sensitive operations
2. **Organization Scoping**: Ensure data isolation between organizations
3. **Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages for permission issues
4. **Testing**: Test both ADMIN and MEMBER user scenarios
5. **API Design**: Use intuitive endpoints like my-notes, my-todos

## Frontend Integration Tips

### Signup Form
- **Organization Selection**: Use `/api/v1/organizations/public` for dropdown
- **Search**: Implement search with `/api/v1/organizations/search?q={name}`
- **Validation**: Check if organization exists before allowing signup

### Dashboard
- **Content Tabs**: Separate "All Content" and "My Content" views
- **Role Indicators**: Show user role and permissions clearly
- **Admin Panel**: Only show user management for ADMIN users

### Navigation
- **Conditional Menus**: Hide admin features from MEMBER users
- **Permission Checks**: Disable buttons for unauthorized actions
- **User Feedback**: Show clear messages for permission errors
